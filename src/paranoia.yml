    Welcome to Paranoia!
    HOW TO PLAY:
    Just press <RETURN> until you are asked to make a choice.
    Select 'a' or 'b' or whatever for your choice, then press <RETURN>.
    You may select 'p' at any time to get a display of your statistics.;
    Always choose the least dangerous option.  Continue doing this until
    you win.  At times you will use a skill or engage in combat and and
    will be informed of the outcome.  These sections will be self
    explanatory.
    HOW TO DIE:
    As Philo-R-DMD you will die at times during the adventure.  When this
    happens you will be given an new clone at a particular location.  The
    new Philo-R will usually have to retrace some of the old Philo-R's
    path; hopefully he won't make the same mistake as his predecessor.
    HOW TO WIN:
    Simply complete the mission before you expend all six clones.  If you
    make it, congratulations.  If not, you can try again later.

    "Greetings," says the kindly Internal Security self incrimination
    expert who meets you at the door, "How are we doing today?"
    He offers you a doughnut and coffee and asks what brings you here.
    This doesn't seem so bad, so you tell him that you have come to confess
    some possible security lapses.  He smiles knowingly, deftly catching
    your coffee as you slump to the floor.
    "Nothing to be alarmed about; it's just the truth serum," he says,
    dragging you back into a discussion room.
    The next five hours are a dim haze, but you can recall snatches of
    conversation about your secret society, your mutant power, and your
    somewhat paranoid distrust of The Computer.  This should explain why
    you are hogtied and moving slowly down the conveyer belt towards the
    meat processing unit in Food Services.

    You walk to the nearest Computer terminal and request more information

    The computer says, "Troubleshooter, you are not wearing the correct
    color uniform.  You must put on an Ultraviolet uniform immediately.  I
    have seen to your needs and ordered one already; it will be here
    shortly.  Please wait with your back to the wall until it arrives.
    In less than a minute an infrared arrives carrying a white bundle.  He
    asks you to sign for it, then hands it to you and stands back, well
    outside of a fragmentation grenade's blast radius.

    The uniform definitely makes you look snappy and pert.  It really
    looks impressive, and even has the new lopsided lapel fashion that you
    admire so much.  What's more, citizens of all ranks come to obsequious
    attention as you walk past.  This isn't so bad being an Ultraviolet.
    You could probably come to like it, given time.

    The corridor lights dim and are replaced by red battle lamps as the
    Security Breach alarms howl all around you.  You run headlong down the
    corridor and desperately windmill around a corner, only to collide with
    a squad of 12 Blue clearance Vulture squadron soldiers.
    "Stop, Slime Face," shouts the commander, "or there won't be enough of
    you left for a tissue sample."
    "All right, soldiers, stuff the greasy traitor into the uniform," he
    orders, waving the business end of his blue laser scant inches from
    your nose.
    With his other hand he shakes open a white bundle to reveal a pristine
    new Ultraviolet citizen's uniform. One of the Vulture squadron
    Troubleshooters grabs you by the neck in the exotic and very painful
    Vulture Clamp(tm) death grip (you saw a special about it on the Teela
    O'Malley show), while the rest tear off your clothes and force you
    into the Ultraviolet uniform.  The moment you are dressed they
    step clear and stand at attention. "Thank you for your cooperation,
    sir," says the steely eyed leader of the Vulture Squad.
    "We will be going about our business now."
    With perfect timing the Vultures wheel smartly and goosestep down the
    corridor.
    Special Note: don't make the mistake of assuming that your skills have
    improved any because of the uniform; you're only a Red Troubleshooter
    traitorously posing as an Ultraviolet, and don't you forget it!

    Suddenly, a computer terminal comes to life beside you.

    "Now, about your question, citizen.  Christmas was an old world
    marketing ploy hto induce lower clearance citizens to purchase vast
    quantities of goods, thus accumulation a large amount of credit under
    the control of a single class of citizen known as Retailers.  The
    strategy used is to imply that all good citizens give gifts during
    Christmas, thus if one wishes to be a valuable member of society one
    must also give gifts during Christmas.  More valuable gifts make one a
    more valuable member, and thus did the Retailers come to control a
    disproportionate amount of the currency.  In this way Christmas
    eventually caused the collapse of the old world.
    Understandably, Christmas has been declared a treasonable practice in
    Alpha Complex.
    Thank you for your inquiry."

    Like any good troubleshooter you make the least expensive decision and
    threaten him for information. With lightning like reflexes you whip out
    your laser and stick it up his nose.
    "Talk, you traitorous Christmas celebrator, or who nose what will
    happen to you, yuk yuk," you pun menacingly, and then you notice
    something is very wrong.  He doesn't have a nose.  As a matter of fact
    he's made of one eighth inch cardboard and your laser is sticking
    through the other side of his head.

      that could possibly impede the people's revolution would be someone
      alerting The Computer to our plans (for instance, some enterprising
      Troubleshooter could tell The Computer that the communists have
      liberated the Troubleshooter Training Course and plan to use it as a
      jumping off point from which to undermine the stability of all Alpha

    your current level of training.  You didn't do so well.  We're going to
    start at the beginning with the other student. Ah, here we are, the

    such as the green scaly skin, the third arm growing from the forehead,
    or other similar disfigurements so common with their kind."
    "There are, however, a few rare specimens that show no outward sign of
    their treason. This has been a significant problem, so our researchers
    have been working on a solution. I would like a volunteer to test this
    device," he says, holding up a ray gun looking thing. "It is a mutant

    hands you the mutant detection gun and says, "Here, aim the gun at that
    Troubleshooter and push the small button. If you see a purple light,
    stun him." Grasping the opportunity to prove your worth to The
    Computer, you fire the mutant detection ray at the Troubleshooter.
    A brilliant purple nimbus instantly surrounds his body.  You slip your
    finger to the large stun button and he falls writhing to the
    floor.
    "Good shot," says the instructor as you hand him the mutant detection
    gun, "I'll see that you get a commendation for this.  It seems you have
    the hang of mutant detection and elimination.  You can go on to the

    Please step forward."
    The Troubleshooter looks around with a "who me?" expression on his
    face, but since he is the only one visible in the audience he figures
    his number is up.
    He walks down to the podium clutching his Action Troubleshooter(tm)
    doll before him like a weapon. "Here," says Plato-B-PHI, "take the
    mutant detection ray and point it at the audience. If there are any
    mutants out there we'll know soon enough."
    Suddenly your skin prickles with static electricity as a bright purple

    open doors faster than an 'ultra shock' plasma cannon. You are certain
