  Welcome to Paranoia!
  HOW TO PLAY:
  Just press <RETURN> until you are asked to make a choice.
  Select 'a' or 'b' or whatever for your choice, then press <RETURN>.
  You may select 'p' at any time to get a display of your statistics.;
  Always choose the least dangerous option.  Continue doing this until
  you win.  At times you will use a skill or engage in combat and and
  will be informed of the outcome.  These sections will be self
  explanatory.
  HOW TO DIE:
  As Philo-R-DMD you will die at times during the adventure.  When this
  happens you will be given an new clone at a particular location.  The
  new Philo-R will usually have to retrace some of the old Philo-R's
  path; hopefully he won't make the same mistake as his predecessor.
  HOW TO WIN:
  Simply complete the mission before you expend all six clones.  If you
  make it, congratulations.  If not, you can try again later.
