    How to play: You may select 'p' at any time to get a display of your statistics.  Always choose the least dangerous option.  Continue doing this until you win.  At times you will use a skill or engage in combat and and will be informed of the outcome.  These sections will be self explanatory.

  <string name="how_to_die">
    HOW TO DIE: As Philo-R-DMD you will die at times during the adventure. When this happens you will be given an new clone at a particular location.  The new Philo-R will usually have to retrace some of the old Philo-R's path; hopefully he won't make the same mistake as his predecessor.
  </string>
  <string name="how_to_win">
    HOW TO WIN: Simply complete the mission before you expend all six clones.  If you make it, congratulations.  If not, you can try again later.

    In the centre of the room is a table and a single chair.  There is an Orange folder on the table top, but you can't make out the lettering on it.

  <string name="page_57_c1">You sit down and read the folder.</string>
